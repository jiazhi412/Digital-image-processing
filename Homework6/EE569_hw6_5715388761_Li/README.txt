1.	Introduction
In the folder, there are three parts of codes. First part of codes is absolutely written by myself. And for the second part like saab_compact.py, I just make several modifications on it like adding several necessary function. The last part like Getfeature_compact.py and Getkernel_compact.py has no changes. I just used them directly.
